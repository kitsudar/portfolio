          <h4>I just finished reading:</h4>
          <em>Designing with Web Standards (3rd Edition)<br /> by Jeffrey Zeldman</em><hr>
            <span class="blog-date">JANUARY 13, 2015</span><br />
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-3rd-Edition/dp/0321616952" target="_blank"><img src="img/zeldman_book.jpg" alt="Designing with Web Standards by Jeffrey Zeldman book photo"></a>
            <p>This book was such a great read. Jefferey Zeldman was very engaging with his witty and humour style of writing. From this book, I learned the history of the web and how there was no standards back then and everything was built with tables. He explained the differences between HTML and XHTML markups. He explained why web standards are important and how they can be utilized to produce semantic markup. He provided a lot of examples of different sites and explained if they were structured correctly or not. The book discussed the browser compatibility and the work-arounds.</p>
            <p>This book was not a tutorial book and more informational-based. He provided an example and created a mock-up site towards the end of the book. As with any technology book, certain content gets dated (considering the book was written in 2009) it is still a classic book worth reading.</p>
