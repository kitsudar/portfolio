          <h4>I just finished reading:<br />
          <em></em>Designing with Web Standards (3rd Edition) by Jeffrey Zeldman</em></h4>

            <p>This book was such a great read. Jefferey Zeldman was very engaging with his witty and humour style of writing. From this book, I learned the history of the web and how there was no standards back then and everything was built with tables. He explained the differences between HTML and XHTML markups.He explained why web standards are important and how they can be utilized to produce semantic markup properly. He provided a lot of examples of different sites and explained how they were structured and what was wrong with them. The book discussed the browser compatibility and the work-arounds.</p>
            <p>This book was not a tutorial book and more informational-based. Although he did provide an example and created a mock-up site towards the end of the book. As with any technology book, certain content gets dated (considering the book was written in 2009) it is still a classic book worth reading.</p>
